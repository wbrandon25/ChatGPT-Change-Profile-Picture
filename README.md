# Installation 
First of all you will have to install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) plugin for your browser on PC (if you're on a mobile then Kiwi browser for Android and Userscripts for Safari on iOS will work just as well). Then you'll have to install the userscript, which can be done in multiple ways, but the easiest is probably to just download the ChatGPT-Change-Profile-Picture.js file in the releases page and Tampermonkey should detect it and open the installation page. If not, copy the contents of the file, and then in Tampermonkey's options click the + tab to create a new script. Paste the copied contents into it and save it. Make sure the script is enabled by navigating the Installed Userscripts tab. <br/>

# Usage
By default, the custom profile picture is the dog shown in the image preview. To use your own image, open the TamperMonkey extension, click Dashboard, and click on ChatGPT-Change-Profile-Picture to view the code. Replace the customImageUrl variable with the link with your custom url. <br/>
